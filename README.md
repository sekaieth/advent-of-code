# Advent of Code Solutions Repository

Welcome to my Advent of Code (AoC) solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges for multiple years. Advent of Code is an annual event consisting of Christmas-themed programming puzzles that can be solved using any programming language.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is created by Eric Wastl. It's a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. More information about the event can be found on the [official website](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Repository Structure

The solutions in this repository are organized by year. Each year has its own directory:

- `Year20XX`
- `Year20YY`
- ...

Within each year's directory, you will find:
- Individual directories for each day (`Day01`, `Day02`, `Day03`, ...)
- A `README.md` in each day's directory containing the puzzle description
- Solution code and any input data provided by AoC for that day

## How to Use

To view or run the solutions, navigate to the year you are interested in and then to the specific day. Follow any instructions provided in the `README.md` file for that day's challenge.

## Contributing

While this is a personal repository for my own AoC solutions, I welcome discussions, suggestions, and different approaches to these puzzles. Feel free to open an issue or a pull request to discuss the puzzles or propose improvements.
